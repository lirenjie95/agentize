# AI-powered SDK for Software Development

[![Tests](https://github.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools

- **Git** - Version control (checked during installation)
- **Make** - Build automation (checked during installation)
- **Bash** - Shell interpreter, version 3.2+ (checked during installation)
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** or **GitLab CLI (`glab`)** - Required for forge integration features
  - For GitHub: https://cli.github.com/ — authenticate with `gh auth login`
  - For GitLab: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli — authenticate with `glab auth login`
    - For self-hosted GitLab: `glab auth login --hostname gitlab.company.com`
  - Used by: `/setup-viewboard`, `/open-issue`, `/open-pr`, `/open-mr`, workflow automation
- **Python 3.10+** - Required for permission automation module, otherwise you can have infinite `yes` to prompt!
  - Use Python `venv` or `anaconda` to manage a good Python release!
  - Requires **PyYAML** (`pip install pyyaml`) for YAML configuration parsing

### Recommended Libraries

- **Anthropic Python Library** - For custom AI integrations (optional)
  - Install: `pip install anthropic`
  - Note: Not required for core SDK functionality, but recommended if you plan to extend or customize AI-powered features

### Verification

After installing prerequisites, the installer will automatically verify `git`, `make`, and `bash` availability. Forge CLI authentication can be verified with:

```bash
gh auth status      # GitHub
glab auth status    # GitLab
```

## Quick Start

Agentize is an AI-powered SDK that helps you build your software projects
using Claude Code powerfully. It is splitted into two main components:

1. **Claude Code Plugin**: Automatically registered during installation when `claude` CLI is available.
   See [Tutorial 00a: Claude UI Setup](./docs/tutorial/00a-claude-ui-setup.md) for details.
2. **CLI Tool**: A source-first CLI tool to help you manage your projects using Agentize.
   See [Tutorial 00: CLI Quickstart](./docs/tutorial/00-cli-quickstart.md) for the CLI workflow.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SyntheSys-Lab/agentize/main/scripts/install | bash
```

Then add to your shell RC file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
source $HOME/.agentize/setup.sh
```

See [docs/feat/cli/install.md](./docs/feat/cli/install.md) for installation options and troubleshooting.

**Upgrade:** Run `lol upgrade` to pull the latest changes.

## Your First 15 Minutes

After installation, the installer creates `~/.agentize.local.yaml` in your home folder. This file controls which AI backends are used for planning and implementation.

### The 5-Step Agentize CLI Workflow

1. **Configure** (already done) - confirm `~/.agentize.local.yaml` exists and adjust backends if needed

2. **Clone** with worktrees:
   ```bash
   wt clone https://github.com/org/repo.git myproject.git
   # or for GitLab:
   wt clone https://gitlab.com/org/repo.git myproject.git
   ```
   `wt clone` sets up a bare repository and leaves you in `trees/main`.

3. **Plan** your first feature:
   ```bash
   lol plan --editor
   ```
   Review the GitHub issue it creates.

4. **Implement** the plan:
   ```bash
   lol impl <issue-number>
   ```

5. **Navigate** between worktrees:
   ```bash
   wt goto <issue-number>
   wt goto main
   ```

See [Tutorial 00: CLI Quickstart](./docs/tutorial/00-cli-quickstart.md) for a full walkthrough.

## Troubleshoot

If you encounter any issue during the usage. For example:
1. It asks you for permission on a really simple operation.
2. It fails to automatically continue on a session.

Enable debug mode in your `.agentize.local.yaml`:

```yaml
handsoff:
  debug: true
```

Then re-run the command. This will give you a detailed log in either
- `/path/to/your/project/.tmp/handsoff-debug.log` or
- `$HOME/.agentize/.tmp/handsoff-debug.log`
Paste your logs on issue for me (@were) to debug!

## Core Philosophy

Minimizing human intervention by artifact centric.
- Session-centric: People tell AI what to do, and wait until it ends.
  Then give feedback until they are satisfied. Human looping in too much
  limits the scalability.
- Artifact-centric: People tell AI what to do, and AI produces a plan first.
  Plan is the ONLY phase that human can intervene. After the plan is approved,
  AI will execute the plan and produce the code merge for human to review.

A clear separation between human, AI, and formal language.
- Humans are for the intention of development, including providing feature requirements,
  approving plans, and code merges.
- AI is the worker of software development for both making the plan, and maintaining the codebase,
  including tests, documentation, and code quality.
- Formal language is for the coordination and orchestration between AI, and other systems,
  e.g. Github Issues, Pull Requests, and CI/CD pipelines.
  - I (@were) found that skills are promising for AI to synthesize fixed code to interact with such
    systems, but these flows are more fixed and formal than I expected --- putting them in formal
    language (e.g. Python scripts, or YAML configuration) is more transparent and faster to execute
    the whole workflow.

### Workflow:

See our detailed workflow diagrams:

- [Ultra Planner Workflow](./docs/feat/core/ultra-planner.md) - Multi-agent debate-based planning
- [Issue to Implementation Workflow](./docs/feat/core/issue-to-impl.md) - Complete development cycle

**Legend**: Red boxes represent user interventions (providing requirements, approving/rejecting results, starting sessions). Blue boxes represent automated AI steps.
